Created to predictions about abalone given various physical attributes. Prediction of the age is done
with linear regression, and prediction of the sex with logistic regression. 
The dataset was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

The data file contains the following columns:

    Name		Data Type	Meas.	Description1
    ----		---------	-----	-----------
    Sex		nominal			M, F, and I (infant)
    Length		continuous	mm	Longest shell measurement
    Diameter	continuous	mm	perpendicular to length
    Height		continuous	mm	with meat in shell
    Whole weight	continuous	grams	whole abalone
    Shucked weight	continuous	grams	weight of meat
    Viscera weight	continuous	grams	gut weight (after bleeding)
    Shell weight	continuous	grams	after being dried
    Rings		integer			+1.5 gives the age in years
